I am a electrical engineering major at CSUF and I plan to graduating next semester 

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 1, part 1
This is my first favorite lab because this is where all the fun of this semester starts. I am really sure that every computer science student has to start with the first project named hello.cc or helloworld.cc. In this lab, I first learned how to print out a message using the C language and push it to GitHub.

Lab 3, part 1
This is my second favorite lab since it will convert between units. As an engineering student, units are one of the most important parts of all formulas. Based on this lab, I can code a program that converts not only between milliliters and teaspoons but all the units I learned during my time at CSUF. So I no longer have to remember constants to convert units.

Lab 7, part 1
This is my least favorite lab because it took me the longest time to complete. In this lab, I have to write a program that, if I input the street name, will show me if I am allowed to park on that street or not. I really enjoyed this lab because I thought it was easy at first, but it turned out to be really hard. After spending about 15-20 hours, I finally completed it perfectly.
